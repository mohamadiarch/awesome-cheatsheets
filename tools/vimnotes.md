* **snippet engins**
 
1. github.com/SirVer/ultisnips: python, supports all snippets in this repo.
2. github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate: VimL, snipmate-snippets, engine sometimes behaves strange. Supports snippets/*
3. github.com/Shougo/neosnippet: VimL, supports snippets/* with some configuration.
4. github.com/dcampos/nvim-snippy: Lua, supports snippets/* with some configuration.
5. github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip: Lua, supports snippets/* with some configuration. Also supports redefining snippets without changing the priority, unlike nvim-snippy.
6. github.com/drmingdrmer/xptemplate: Totally different syntax, does not read snippets contained in this file, but it is also very powerful. It does not support vim-snippets (just listing it here for completeness)
